In this i coded all about these 4 problems :
1) The 8-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space.
The goal is to reach a target configuration starting from an initial arrangement by sliding tiles into the empty space.
2)The Water Jug Problem is a classic puzzle in Artificial Intelligence and problem solving.
You are given two jugs with different capacities (say, 4 liters and 3 liters) and an unlimited supply of water. The challenge is to measure exactly X liters of water using only these jugs.
3)Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid.
One player uses X and the other uses O.
Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
The goal is to be the first to form a straight line of three marks — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4)The Water Jug Problem involves two jugs with different capacities and the objective is to measure out a specific amount of water using these jugs.
 You can fill, empty, or pour water between the jugs.
